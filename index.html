                <p>This is our actual project. On this project we took boxes recycled them and turned them into chicago sky line. Then we used a light to creat a shadow so that we were able to see the shadow behind it.</p>

                <p>On this project we created a sound wave that recorded a voice saying "America rapes the people". This project we took the sound wave from the paper and made it 3D using wood. This was not the final product it was a draft.</p>

                <p>This is a project that I did my sophomore year in highschool. We did a shark tank theme project where we had to creat a elevator pitch. Mines was called Design Massage where I created a full body massage suit for athletes and people with sore muscles.</p>

                <p>This is also a project from my sophomore year in highschool. On this project we took a personality test and matched our personality to the jobs that would best fit us in the future. My personality added up to be a Attorney so then I created what my facebook page would look like in the future with all my jobs, diplomas, and schools.</p>
