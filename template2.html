                    <h1>My Definig Moment</h1>
                    <p>My First Love, My First Heartbreak.

Meeting him made me the person that I am today. I met him on the third day of 7th grade and the first thought that ran threw my head was ew!!! As the year went on I started to like him as a friend. Summer came and we seen each other around but never thought anything about it. So then came 8th grade we both realized that we liked each other then we started to “Talk”. I was young so I didn't really know anything about boys but he taught me THE HARD WAY.

He taught me that no one is to be trusted and he also taught me to never regret anything just take it as a lesson learned. He also taught me that the past is the past for a reason. Meeting him is a moment that has shaped me into being that person that I am today because he’s that reason why  so cold hearted and why I don't really care about others feelings. I could say that it's all because of him but then I wouldn't be owning up to my faults as a woman. It's my fault I kept going through the same thing over and over because I kept letting him back in my life Even after he broke my heart and was the reason I cried at night because i believed that “If it's real itll come back”. Now I see that if it's real it'll never leave by your side no matter what the situation is.
	
Back then I was VERY young but now I can say that i'm much wiser and smarter. I now know that i'm the prize and he should be trying to please me instead of me trying to please him. Also I now know that boys will say anything to get what they want.

I take everything that I went through in that relationship as a life lesson. Sometimes people don't change and you can’t sit around waiting on them to change because then you'll miss out on opportunities.
